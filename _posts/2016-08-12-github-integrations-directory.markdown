We're happy to be included by GitHub in their official [Integrations Directory](https://github.com/integrations/siteleaf). 

Connect your website repo with Siteleaf and your Markdown content is editable in a friendly CMS designed with non-technical writers and clients in mind. Build sites using the tools you love, and make it easy to others to contribute without having to write code or understand Git.
