  url: https://siteleaf.typeform.com/to/EoFRli
features:
- title: Open source superpowers
  body:
  - title: Compatible with a larger ecosystem
    body: We’ve reimagined Siteleaf to be built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
      Enjoy the benefits of a large open source community, along with the accessibility
      of the Siteleaf interface you’ve come to love. Use any off-the-shelf Jekyll
      theme, or take your Siteleaf theme with you.
  - title: Portable source code
    body: Now with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, your entire site’s source
      code and content are portable, not just the compiled HTML. Move sites into and
      out of Siteleaf easily. Even compile it yourself without using Siteleaf. You’ll
      never be locked into a CMS again.
  - title: Import from v1, WordPress, and more
    body: Export your existing v1 site content to v2-ready Jekyll format using the
      Siteleaf gem. You can also import from WordPress, Tumblr, Ghost, Drupal, and
      more using the <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/">community-supported Jekyll
      importers</a>.

- title: GitHub integration
  body:
  - title: Theme syncing
    body: No more manually pushing and pulling your theme changes using the command
      line. Siteleaf will automatically sync theme changes directly with <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>,
      with no need to install a Siteleaf gem.
  - title: Time machine for your content
    body: No more accidental overwrites or deletes. Every edit you (or other authors)
      make in Siteleaf is synced to GitHub, including content and theme changes. See
      a log of edits, who made them, and revert back to any state with the Git tools
      you already use.

- title: Customized content
  body:
  - title: Advanced metadata
    body: Metadata now supports nested lists and objects, plus a shiny new interface
      that supports drag and drop ordering and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults">Jekyll
      defaults</a>. A lot of other cool things coming soon too, including smart fields
      for files, dates, booleans and more. It’s the metadata editor of your dreams!
  - title: Custom permalinks
    body: Customize the way your site is generated. Choose date-based permalinks (`/2015/10/20/hello-world`),
      pretty permalinks (`/posts/hello-world`), or whatever suits your needs.
  - title: More than just pages and posts
    body: Now in addition to pages and posts, you can create custom sets of content
      (called Collections), each with their own entries (called Documents). Choose
      to output your documents just like posts, or simply use them as super-metadata
      within your theme.

- title: Optimized workflow
  body:
  - title: Offline development
    body: Sync your Siteleaf content to local Markdown files and develop your site
      completely offline. Work faster, even without an internet connection.
  - title: Free publishing
    body: While we’ve always had free accounts for developers, publishing was reserved
      for paid accounts only. We’re now making it possible to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
      Pages</a>, totally free for developers and open source projects.
  - title: Built-in preprocessors
    body: Siteleaf now includes built-in support for compiling <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>,
      SCSS, and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, thanks to the
      power of Jekyll.

- title: And everything you already love
  body:
  - title: A smart Markdown editor
    body: Siteleaf’s Markdown editor lets you focus on writing, with simple controls
      to help out only if you need it. Drag and drop an image and we’ll insert its
      code. Even drop an entire text file. We’ll take care of the details.
  - title: Collaboration
    body: Collaboration is still easy, using the same Siteleaf interface your client
      or team is familiar with. Let them tinker all they want, without touching a
      single line of code. Siteleaf supports different user roles, like Admin, Publisher,
      and Writer.
  - title: Publish fast, secure sites anywhere
    body: Siteleaf generates static files when you publish, which means your site
      is fast, secure, and doesn’t rely on a database or complicated server setup.
      Publish to FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, GitHub Pages, and Rackspace Cloud Files.
  - title: An API for your content
    body: Siteleaf provides a JSON API for interacting with all of your Jekyll content.
      Integrate it into other sites, apps, or anything you want. It’s your data.

We're currently hard at work on version 2 of Siteleaf, which brings with it a bunch of new features and improvements that we're eager to show off (see below). While we wrap things up, we're inviting a small batch of good people to try things out and provide feedback. Interested?
