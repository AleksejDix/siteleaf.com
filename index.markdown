    body:
      No more accidental overwrites or deletes. Any change made in Siteleaf can be synced to GitHub, where you can see a log of edits, who made them, and roll back to any state, giving you a **time machine for your content**.


      As you develop your theme, Siteleaf can also update to reflect the changes you push to GitHub. Fits right into your existing workflow.
