faqs:
- title: What's early-bird pricing?
  body: To celebrate the launch of Siteleaf v2 and show appreciation to early adopters,
    we're offering a pretty sweet deal on our site plans. Sign up while we have early-bird
    pricing to lock in the price before it's gone.
- title: How do subscriptions work?
  body: Each new site you create starts with a **free 14 day trial** on the Personal
    plan. No credit card is required to get started. When your trial expires, you'll
    be prompted to select a plan. Each site is billed monthly. You can upgrade or
    downgrade at any time and your next month's bill will be prorated.
- title: Can I use my legacy v1 plan?
  body: Yes! You can create a v2 site using your legacy plan, grandfathered at its
    current price. If you’re using a legacy plan you’ll be held to any user and site
    limits associated with that plan. You can always upgrade to a v2 plan from your
    Site’s settings page and cancel your legacy plan from your account page. You can
    also add additional v2 sites on top of your legacy plan if you hit your limit.
- title: Is there a cost per user?
  body: All v2 plans come with **unlimited users** at no extra cost. You can invite
    your clients, writers, and teammates without having to pay extra. For those on
    a grandfathered plan, user limits may apply (see your account page for details).
- title: What are the page and storage limits?
  body: Trial and Developer sites are limited to 100 MB and 100 pages, including posts
    and documents. Personal sites are limited to 500 MB and 500 pages. All other plans,
    including grandfathered plans come with 1 GB of storage and unlimited pages.
- title: Have more questions?
  body: No problem. Send a message to us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/siteleaf)
    or contact [billing@siteleaf.com](mailto:billing@siteleaf.com?subject=Question%20about%20your%20plans).
