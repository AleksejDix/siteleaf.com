headline: A new Siteleaf.
button:
  title: Sign up for v2 beta
  url: https://siteleaf.typeform.com/to/EoFRli
features:
- title: Open source superpowers.
  is_nested: true
  body:
  - title: Compatible with a larger ecosystem
    body: We’ve reimagined Siteleaf to be built on Jekyll. Enjoy the benefits of a
      large open source community, along with the accessibility of the Siteleaf interface
      you’ve come to love. Use any off-the-shelf Jekyll theme, or take your Siteleaf
      theme with you.
  - title: Portable code
    body: Now with Jekyll, your entire site’s source code and content are portable,
      not just the compiled HTML. Move sites into and out of Siteleaf easily. Even
      compile it yourself without using Siteleaf. You’ll never be locked into a CMS
      again.
  - title: Import from v1, WordPress, and more
    body: Export your existing v1 site content to v2-ready Jekyll format using the
      existing Siteleaf gem (`siteleaf export`). You can also import from WordPress,
      Tumblr, Ghost, Drupal, and more using the community-supported Jekyll importers.

- title: GitHub integration.
  is_nested: true
  body:
  - title: Theme syncing
    body: No more manually pushing and pulling your theme changes using the command
      line. Siteleaf will automatically sync theme changes directly with GitHub, with
      no need to install a Siteleaf gem.
  - title: Time machine for your content
    body: No more accidental overwrites or deletes. Every edit you (or other authors)
      make in Siteleaf is synced to GitHub, including content and theme changes. See
      a log of edits, who made them, and revert back to any state with the Git tools
      you already use.

- title: Better suited for your needs.
  is_nested: true
  body:
  - title: Advanced metadata
    body: Metadata now supports nested lists and objects, plus a shiny new interface
      that supports drag and drop ordering. It’s the metadata editor of your dreams.
      Lots more coming soon, including magic fields for images, dates, and more.
  - title: Custom permalinks
    body: Customize the way your site is generated. Choose date-based permalinks (`/2015/10/20/hello-world`),
      pretty permalinks (`/posts/hello-world`), or whatever suits your needs.
  - title: More than just pages and posts
    body: Now in addition to pages and posts, you can create custom sets of content
      (called Collections), each with their own entries (called Documents). Choose
      to output your documents just like posts, or simply use them as super-metadata
      within your theme.

- title: An optimized workflow.
  is_nested: true
  body:
  - title: Offline development
    body: Sync your Siteleaf content to local Markdown files and develop your site
      completely offline. Work faster, even without an internet connection.
  - title: Built-in preprocessors
    body: Siteleaf now includes built-in support for compiling Sass, SCSS, and CoffeeScript,
      thanks to the power of Jekyll. The future is now.
  - title: Free publishing
    body: While we’ve always had free accounts for developers, publishing was reserved
      for paid accounts only. We’re now making it possible to publish to GitHub Pages,
      totally free for developers and open source projects.

- title: Plus, all that you already love about Siteleaf.
  is_nested: true
  body:
  - title: A smart Markdown editor
    body: Siteleaf’s Markdown editor lets you focus on writing, with simple controls
      to help out only if you need it. Drag and drop an image and we’ll insert its
      code. Even drop an entire text file. We’ll take care of the details.
  - title: Collaboration
    body: 'Collaboration is still easy, using the same Siteleaf interface your client
      or team is familiar with. Let them tinker all they want, without touching a
      single line of code. Siteleaf supports different user roles: Admin, Publisher,
      or Writer.'
  - title: Publish fast, secure sites anywhere
    body: Siteleaf generates static files when you publish, which means your site
      is fast, secure, and doesn’t rely on a database or complicated server setup.
      Publish to FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, GitHub Pages, and Rackspace Cloud Files.
  - title: An API for your content
    body: Siteleaf provides a JSON API for interacting with all of your Jekyll content.
      Integrate it into other sites, apps, or anything you want. It’s your data.
