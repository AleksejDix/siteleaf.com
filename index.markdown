      Siteleaf is compatible with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator for over half a million websites running on GitHub Pages.

      Benefit from a large open source community. Use any existing Jekyll theme, or write your own using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Develop locally and even offline.

      No more accidental overwrites or deletes. Any change made in Siteleaf can be synced to [GitHub](https://github.com/), where you can see a log of edits and roll back to any state, giving you a time machine for your content.

      As you develop your theme, Siteleaf can also automatically update to reflect your GitHub commits. Fits right into your existing workflow.

    We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to host your website wherever you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. Our tools should be simple, but never dumbed down.

    Static sites are faster, more secure, and keep visitors happy. And speed matters: According to Google, **nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile site if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds**.

    Best of all, unlike legacy CMSs like WordPress and Drupal, your website’s entire source code and content are completely portable. Never be locked into a particular service again. An Open Web is a better web.
