      Siteleaf is compatible with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator for over half a million websites running on GitHub Pages.

      Benefit from a large open source community. Use any existing Jekyll theme, or write your own using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Develop locally and even offline.

      No more accidental overwrites or deletes. Any change made in Siteleaf can be synced to [GitHub](https://github.com/), where you can see a log of edits and roll back to any state, giving you a time machine for your content.

      As you develop your theme, Siteleaf can also automatically update to reflect your GitHub commits. Fits right into your existing workflow.

    We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to host your website wherever you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. Our tools should be simplified, not dumbed down.

    Static sites are fast, secure, and keep visitors happy.

    Your content and code are completely portable, too, so you’ll never be locked into a CMS again. A fast, open web is a better web.
